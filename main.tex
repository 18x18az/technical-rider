\subsection{Base Fee}
Our base fee of \$200 includes field control for two (2) competition fields, one (1) skills field livestream equipment and Tournament Manager (TM) operation.
We have a projector, projector screen and speakers, though if your venue has a suitable alternative for Audio/Visual, please let us know as soon as possible.

\subsection{Third Competition Field}
For an additional \$100, we can support a third competition field.
This will bring up the total fields to three (3) competition fields and one (1) skills field.

\subsection{Field Control LEDs}
For an additional \$50 per field, we will bring LEDs that will be mounted to the field perimeter and will react to field control.

\subsection{Pipe and Drape}
For an additional \$150, we will bring pipe and drape to the venue.
Pipe and drape can be used to make an event look more professional!
Let us know if you would like advice on how to best make use of pipe and drape.

\section{Venue Physical Requirements}
TODO: put diagrams here
\subsection{Mission Control Tables}
2 tables, 2 chairs
\subsection{Power and Ethernet Access}
\subsection{Internet Firewall}
We will need the following websites to be unblocked on the day of setup and event:

TODO: need to find what package my CSE 340 professor uses for listing grammar in the projects because i think it looks cool and we can use the same here
\subsection{Crowd Control Barriers}
Our cameras are pretty expensive so we want barriers around them

\section{Equipment Transportation}
It is plausible we will need help transporting items from our base in Chandler to the venue during the day of setup, especially if we are bringing pipe and drape.
