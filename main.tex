\section{Our Services}
\subsection{Base Package}
Our base package, costing \$200, includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Field control for two (2) competition fields
    \item Field control for one (1) skills field
    \item Livestream equipment and operation
    \item Tournament Manager (TM) operation
    \item Scoring tablets
\end{itemize}
We also have a projector, projector screen and speakers, though if your venue has a suitable alternative for Audio/Visual, please let us know as soon as possible.

\noindent We will livestream the event to our YouTube channel, located at \\\url{http://youtube.18x18az.org}.

\subsection{Large Event Package}
For an additional \$100, we can support field control for a third competition field and a second skills field.
This will bring up the total number of supported fields to three (3) competition fields and two (2) skills fields.

\subsection{Field Control LEDs}
For an additional \$50 per field, we can bring LEDs that will be mounted to the field perimeter and will react to field control.

\subsection{Pipe and Drape}
For an additional \$150, we can bring pipe and drape to the venue.
Pipe and drape can be used to make an event look more professional!
Let us know if you would like advice on how to best make use of pipe and drape.

\section{Venue Requirements}

\subsection{Crowd Control Barriers}
Our camera equipment is expensive, so we want to protect them as best as we can.
If you are able to provide crowd control barriers, such as those that might be found in a lunch line or at an airport's luggage check in, that would be very helpful.
It will also have the benefit of keeping the competition area less congested.

\section{Equipment Transportation}
It is plausible we will need help transporting equipment from our base in Chandler to the venue during the day of setup, especially if we are bringing pipe and drape.
